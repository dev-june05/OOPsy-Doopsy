OOPsy-Doopsy
============

OOPsy-Doopsy is a collection of Java programs designed to illustrate fundamental and advanced concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
This repository serves as a practical resource for students, educators, and developers aiming to understand and apply OOP principles in Java.

Features
--------
- Core OOP Concepts: Examples demonstrating classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- Exception Handling: Programs showcasing try-catch blocks, custom exceptions, and error handling mechanisms.
- Multithreading: Implementations of threads, runnable interfaces, thread priorities, and synchronization.
- File I/O Operations: Reading from and writing to files using Java's I/O classes.
- Algorithmic Implementations: Solutions to common problems like factorial calculation, Fibonacci series, palindrome checking, and more.
